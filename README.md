# [Niji Components](https://niji.ram.codes/)

Welcome to the **Niji component library**! "Niji," meaning "Rainbow" in Japanese, symbolizes the vibrant and diverse range of UI components and styles that this system offers. This design system leverages a combination of CSS libraries and accessibility tools to create inclusive and beautiful user interfaces.

Just as a rainbow encompasses a spectrum of colors, Niji integrates multiple tools and libraries to cover a broad range of design and accessibility needs. Each tool in Niji's ecosystem adds a unique hue, contributing to a holistic, inclusive, and versatile design system.
